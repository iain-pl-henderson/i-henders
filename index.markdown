Welcome to my web page!
<p align="justify">
I am currently a post doc at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT) under the supervision of Adrien Mazoyer and Fabrice Gamboa, working on conformal inference for time series.</p>
<p align="justify">
 I pursued my PhD at INSA Toulouse/Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse (IMT), under the supervision of Pascal Noble (IMT/INSA) and Olivier Roustant (IMT/INSA). The PhD was funded by the Service Hydrographique et Océanographique de la Marine (SHOM), in collaboration with Rémy Baraille (SHOM) in particular.</p>
<p align="justify">
The PhD was motivated by applying machine learning techniques to oceanography, coastal marine forecast and more broadly to physical models described by PDEs.</p>

Prior to my PhD I spent some years on the Plateau de Saclay.

You can find my detailled CV (French, last updated in December 2023) <a href="online_files/pdf/site_cv.pdf">here</a>.
