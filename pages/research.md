My research interests lie at the crossroads of machine learning, random fields and physical models:

 Partial differential equations (PDEs), numerical schemes for PDEs, physics informed machine learning.

 Gaussian processes, Physics informed Kriging, Bayesian inverse problems (for PDEs), Gaussian measures over function spaces.
